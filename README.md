# Hotel_management_system
This project is a Hotel Reservation System developed using Java programming language with JDBC to connect MySQL as the backend database. The main goal of this project is to learn how Java applications interact with databases in a real-world environment. It is a console-based, menu-driven application that allows the user to manage hotel reservations in a simple and effective way.

🎯 Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to understand database connectivity using JDBC and to implement basic hotel management operations such as room allocation, guest information retrieval, room status checking, and checkout functionality. This project also helps in learning how to use SQL queries inside Java programs and how to manage data efficiently.

⚙️ Technologies Used

This project uses Java as the main programming language, JDBC for database connectivity, MySQL as the database system, and the Scanner class for taking user input from the console. These technologies together help in building a simple backend system for hotel reservation management.

🏨 System Features

The system is menu-driven and user-friendly. It allows the user to allocate rooms to guests, retrieve guest details, view room information, and perform checkout operations. Each operation is handled using separate methods, which makes the program modular and easy to maintain. The system also automatically records the check-in and check-out time using MySQL timestamp features.

📊 Database Design

The project uses a database named hotel_db and a table called reservations to store guest information such as guest name, contact number, address, room number, check-in time, and check-out time. This helps in managing hotel data in a structured and organized way.

📚 Learning Outcome

By working on this project, I learned how to connect Java with MySQL using JDBC, how to use PreparedStatement for secure queries, and how to perform CRUD operations in a real application. I also improved my logical thinking and gained confidence in developing small real-world software projects.

🔮 Future Scope

In the future, this project can be enhanced by adding features like room availability checking, billing system, user authentication, and a graphical user interface. These improvements can make the system more powerful and closer to a real hotel management software.
